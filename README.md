> an app to make DnD NPCs with Elm Land

### overview

My friends and I are starting a new Dungeons and Dragons campaign, and I thought it
would be fun to use [`elm/random`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/random/latest/) to
generate some NPCs with the click of a button.


### local development

```
npx elm-land server
```

The app should be running at [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234)
